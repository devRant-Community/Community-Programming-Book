## Introduction

Assembly language(or an assembler) is a low-level programming language which is the lowest abstraction of machine language(binary code). Unlike other high level programming languages, the Assembly Language is not completely portable in the sense that its syntax and semantics varies with the computer architecture(primarily) but the core concepts, essence and functioning remains the same.
