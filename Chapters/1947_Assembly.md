# Assembly Language
---
## Introduction

Assembly language(or an assembler) is a low-level programming language which is the lowest abstraction of machine language(binary code). Unlike other high level programming languages, the Assembly Language is not completely portable in the sense that its syntax and semantics varies with the computer architecture(primarily) but the core concepts, essence and functioning remains the same.
## History

### Creation:
The first assembly language was developed by Kathleen Booth in 1947 for the ARC2 at  Birkbeck, University of London following work with John von Neumann and Herman Goldstine at the Institute for Advanced Study. After this several other variations of assembly language have been developed and higher abstractions of the language have been achieved.

### Purpose:
Back in the day it was extremely tedious,error prone and time consuming for programmers to "code" in binary. Even the smallest of the tasks required huge amount of thinking and calculations. Building huge programs then was a mammoth task. So the assembly languages have been created to get rid of the "tedious" part of coding in binary and to help concentrate more on the problem on hand rather than silly calculations and other laborious tasks.
