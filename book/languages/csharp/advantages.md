# Advantages

C# was designed to be simple and easy to use, its syntax is very natural and non-verbose. As a high-level language, it abstracts away most of the complex details, giving the user an ability to focus on its pure programming tasks instead of worrying about the little bits.

While abstracting away the details, C# doesn't limit your abilities and gives you the option to work on a lower level using features like *Interoperability* which enables you to take advantage of unmanaged code such as C/C++ directly from your code.

C# is a managed programming language which means the programmer need not worry about memory management. It is dealt by the GC (Garbage collector) of the .NET Framework.

Another advantage of managed code is that it becomes platform-independent, meaning that it can be run on any platform with .Net Framework installed, but it's not limited to it.
Thanks to Mono project, there are other technologies that support C# as its primary language. Tools like Unity and Xamarin allow you to write C# code and run it on any platform of your choice.

It's a type-safe compiled language, meaning that your code is verified by the compiler before its execution, making your code more resilient to runtime errors by catching them ahead of time.

C# belongs to the C-family of programming languages and anyone comfortable in using other languages belonging to the same family like C, C++ or Java will feel comfortable in using it.
