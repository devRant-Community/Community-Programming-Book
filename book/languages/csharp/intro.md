# Introduction

C# is an elegant object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of powerful and secure applications.

It can be used to create Windows apps, Web services, Mobile apps, VR, Games and much more.

C# is a managed code, meaning that C# program requires and only executes under the management of a CLR (Common Language Runtime) virtual machine.

C# runs on the .NET framework just like the way Java runs on a JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
