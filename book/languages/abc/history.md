# History

## Creation

ABC was created in the early 1980s by Leo Geurts, Lambert Meertens and Steven Pemberton at
the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. ABC language was developed iteratively
with it being the fourth iteration. All the previous versions/iterations of this language were called as B.

It is said that the first version of B appeared in 1969. So we can say that ABC went through a long
phase of development and changes before it took its current form.

Note that B is not a predecessor of the C programming language.

## Purpose

ABC was intended for teaching and prototyping purposes rather than systems programming.
It was created to replace some older languages such as BASIC, Pascal and AWK. As it turns out ABC
is easier to learn than BASIC but more powerful than Pascal. It's initial aims were to be:

* Simple

* Interactive

* Structured
