ABC was not designed to solve a specific purpose or problem, instead it was intended for general
purpose programming. It was created to be easy to learn and use yet include powerful features.
Programming in this language is relatively more intuitive and easy. It was the first language to have
implemented indented blocks of code which has also been adopted in python. A better explanation on
its powerful features are mentioned in the next section.
