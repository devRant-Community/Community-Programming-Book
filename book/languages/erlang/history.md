# History

## Erlang, and its name meaning

The name *Erlang* was given in honor of the first scientist in the field of telecommunications: **Agner Krarup Erlang (1878-1929)**, Dunstan's mathematics, **pioneer in telecommunications traffic theory** and queue theory. Sometimes the name of language is sometimes interpreted as **Er**icsson + *Lang*uage = **Er***lang*.

## In Ericsson lab

**Between 1982 and 1986**, in Ericsson labs were conducted research on the suitability of some existing programming languages in terms of creating apps for **telecommunications** needs,
which required **long-lasting** and **trouble-free operation with a large number of threads**.
The features of each lamguage were analyzed, identyfiying potentional problems that they could have caused.
Despite the gradual narrowing of the set of considered languages, it was established that **none** of them meets the company's requirements, therefore it was decided to design a **completely new language from scratch**.

## Long story in short edition

The author of the language is **Joe Armstrong**.
He modeled Erlang on the **Prolog language** and wrote first Erlang interpreter in it.
In **1990**, Erlang was shown publicly at the **ISS '90 conference**, which result was increased amount of users.
But the first implementation of the language was inefficent so already in **late '80s** work on faster version began.
**It's final release took place in 1991**.
**Year later**, was published first book about Erlang and in **1993** Ericsson launched independent department with the development and distribution of the system and tools for it.

In **1998**, Ericsson launched **AXD301** switch with software that contained a milion lines of code in Erlang, which achieved a reliability index of **99.9999999%** (that's the real number!), which meant that within a year of the system could have **at most 0.0315 seconds of downtime due to a failure**.
Shortly thereafter, Ericsson banned its affiliates from using Erlang in new products due to its proprietary nature.
**This caused a conflict between Ericsson and Armstrong, who left the company with the team.**
**At the end of the same year**, the Erlang implementation code was **opened and made available as free software**.
The ban was withdrawn in later years, and **Armstrong** returned to work at Ericsson in **2004**.
