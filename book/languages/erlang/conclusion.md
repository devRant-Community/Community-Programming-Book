# Conclusion

Erlang has a crazy syntax, and that's the reason why some don't like it.
I like it, because I like its creators, Ericsson company.
I think Erlang should have more fans, maybe not the fans of the syntax, but at least fans of this language.
It has amazing features and need more attention than it has now.
