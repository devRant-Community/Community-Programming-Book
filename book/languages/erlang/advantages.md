# Advantages of Erlang

Some of the Erlang advantages are:

* **Concurrency**

* **Built in dispersion**

        You can create processes with any node on any node.

* **Error handling**

        When the process breaks down, it leaves and sends a message to the process a control who can take the appropriate action - e.g. restart or end broken process and start the next one.

* **Dynamic and strong typing discipline**

* **Support for multiprocessor systems**

* **Hot code upgrade**

        You don't have to stop system to update code.
