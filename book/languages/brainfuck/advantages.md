Generally speaking, currently Brainfuck is seen as joke language, or proof-of-concept language. Therefore it's not very efficent,
nor easy to write.

First of all, it's really good excercise for your brain! Brainfuck, as name suggests, is very hard to write and read, but not understand!
You don't have to waste a lot of time just to understand this passionating language, you can view it as Sudoku of programming.

Also, Brainfuck is great learning tool. You can create code generators, optimizing interpreters, learn JIT & AOT compilation basics,
compiler construction (by, for example, creating compiler from Brainfuck to C or some kind of assembly language to Brainfuck).

Brainfuck is really simple too! It consists of eight instructions so it's really easy to learn. 

Let's imagine Brainfuck computer - it would consume really small amount of power (x86 has wide instruction set, ARM has it tighter, while Brainfuck
destroys other real architectures having only eight!) and excel in simple tasks.

Finally, Brainfuck can help to **understand** the basics - how do you multiply two numbers?
How do you create conditional statement? In other languages it might seem simple, but Brainfuck challenges the programmer
creating this unique spirit.
