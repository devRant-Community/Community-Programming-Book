Brainfuck is an awesome language with a wide range of community-made tools.

My work regarding Brainfuck:

* [Izmit3](https://github.com/KrzysztofSzewczyk/Izmit3) ([v1 & v2](https://uw426.mikr.us)) - C to Brainfuck compiler made by me in Perl, maybe as a challenge, maybe for fun.

* [Brainfuck experiments](https://github.com/KrzysztofSzewczyk/Esoteric) - Repository containing a few Brainfuck experiments.

* [Two](https://github.com/KrzysztofSzewczyk/Angelos) [Brianfuck Assemblers](https://github.com/KrzysztofSzewczyk/asm2bfv2) - As the name suggests, I have made a few Brainfuck assemblers.

There is also:

* [Brainfuck compiler in Brainfuck by Matslina](https://github.com/matslina/awib).

* [A few interpreters](https://github.com/rdebath/Brainfuck/tree/master/extras) and [Brainfuck to everything converters](https://github.com/rdebath/Brainfuck/tree/master/bf2any) made by Rdebath
* The fastest Brainfuck interpreter known to me, [Tritium](https://github.com/rdebath/Brainfuck/tree/master/tritium), made by Rdebath.
