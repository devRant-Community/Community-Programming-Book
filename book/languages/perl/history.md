# History

Larry Wall developed Perl in 1986. He was a systems programmer on a project that was developing multilevel, secure wide area
networks. Larry was in charge of an installation. Larry's primary job was system support "guru". During this stint, he developed
several useful UNIX tools such as rn, patch, and warp. Perl was developed in response to a management requirement for a
configuration management and control system. Larry's manager asked him to produce reports. Larry's first thought was to use awk to
produce the reports. Awk couldn't handle opening and closing multiple files based on information in the files. Larry didn't want to
code a special purpose tool just for this job, so a new language was born. You'll find a reference to the former five-letter
version in the entry for the acronym Practical Extraction and Report Language. The manual page was only 15 pages long. But Perl was
faster than sed and awk and began to be used on other aspects of the project. Larry moved on to support research and development 
and took Perl with him. Perl was becoming a good tool for system administration. Larry borrowed Henry Spencer's regular expression 
package and modified it for Perl. Then Larry added most of the goodies he and other people wanted and released it on the Internet.
