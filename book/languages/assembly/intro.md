# About Assembly Language

Assembly language(or an assembler) is a low-level programming language which is the
lowest abstraction of machine language(binary code). It consists of a strong but not one-one
correspondence between its mnemonics and machine instructions supported. Unlike other high level
programming languages, the Assembly Language is not completely portable in the sense that its syntax
and semantics varies with the computer architecture(primarily) but the core concepts, essence and
functioning remains the same.
