# About Assembly Language

Assembly language or an assembler is a low-level programming language, by which it is the
lowest abstraction of machine languages (binary code).

There is a strong, but not complete correspondence between assembly and machine instructions.
The Assembly Language is not completely portable in the sense that its syntax and semantics
remain the same with every computer architecture, but the core concepts, essence and
functioning remain the same.
