## A final word
Assembly language is a big leap from machine code towards higher level languages but like any other programming language assembly also has its own set of merits and demerits.

The reader might wonder why only C was used as a comparison. The reason is C is one of the few high level languages that offers similar speed and performance as assembly or other low level languages and is also highly portable.
