# A final word

Assembly language is a big leap from machine code towards higher level languages, but like any other programming language assembly also has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

You might be wondering why only C was used as a comparison. The reason is that C is one of the few high level languages that offers similar speed and performance as assembly or other low level languages and is also highly portable.
