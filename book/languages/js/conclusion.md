# Conclusion

Many refer JS as a necessary evil. It can help in making the websites more interactive and interesting
while introducing potential problems due to negligible or no validation of its working on the server
end. Although several standards and protocols have been created for the safe execution of JS like
*Sandbox Environment*, *Strict Mode*, *Same origin request policy*, etc it still remains as a potential
gateway to exploit negligent or non careful users.
