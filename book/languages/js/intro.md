# Introduction

## Inception

**JavaScript (JS)**, but the official name is **ECMAScript**.

This language is really fast scripting language using especially for web pages, for **frontend** (Vue.js, React.js etc.) and for **backend** (node.js etc.). It can be used also for creating desktop and mobile native apps (Proton, Electron).
**Brendan Eich** created that language, and it firstly appeared in **December 4, 1995,**. JS became a**ECMA standard in 1997**.
File extension is **.js**

## Why you should use JavaScript?

**You should use JavaScript** because:

- Many of people actually use it, big community,
- It is functionally in most of the browsers,
- If you'll work as JS dev, you will be high paid one,
- Many job offers in which JS is 'must have',
- It is fast language,
- It has many frameworks, I mean, **many frameworks**,
- You could use it where you want (desktop, mobile, web).

## Why you shouldn't use JavaScript?

**You shouldn't use JavaScript** because:

- It is fast, but not as fast as C or Rust,
- Many of people know it, it is good, but for searching one ideal job as a JS dev, it isn't,
- It is nice to have a lot of frameworks, for backend and frontend, but the way, how much frameworks are for JS became a meme.
