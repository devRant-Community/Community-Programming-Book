# Introduction

## Inception

**JavaScript (JS)** is officially known as **ECMAScript**.

This language is a really fast scripting language used especially in web pages, for **frontend** (Vue.js, React.js, etc.) and for **backend** (node.js etc.). It can be used also for creating desktop and mobile native apps (Proton, Electron).
**Brendan Eich** was the creator of JS, and it first appeared in **December 4, 1995,**. JS became an **ECMA standard in 1997**.
File extension is **.js**

## History

**Netscape** had the most popular web browser in the beginning of the 1990s.
 But in late 1995 **Microsoft** came up with their **Internet Explorer** project that (in plans) would dominate over Netscape browser.
Netscape tried not to let Microsoft take control over JavaScript so they partnered with **Sun company**.
Sun started development of **Java** programming language in 1990 trying to make something for *smart* devices. Before their partnership with Netscape, **Sun had their own browser**, but it was slow and always hungry for resources.
 That partnership meant that Sun would get a web browser and a delivery system for their strategic technology and on the other hand, **Netscape would have a partner against Microsoft**.
 **Brendan Eich** who was working with Sun decided to surf the tidal wave of hype surrounding **Java and position JavaScript as a companion language to Java**, in the same way as Visual Basic was to C++.
 The aim of **Netscape Mocha** (later **JavaScript** and officially **ECMAScript**) was to make the  Web a platform for apps to use with **LiveWire** software.
 **JavaScript** has a fascinating and rich history but it's still one of the most hated programming languages on the planet.

## Trademark

Actually **Oracle** have a trademark to JavaScript. Yes, these are the guys from Silicon Valley that are made software to run virtaul machines.

## Why you should use JavaScript?

**You should use JavaScript** because:

- Many of people actually use it, big community,
- It is functional in most of browsers,
- If you'll work as JS dev, you will be high paid one,
- Many job offers in which JS is 'must have',
- It has a high speed of execution,
- It has many frameworks, I mean, **many frameworks**,
- You could use it wherever you want (desktop, mobile, web).

## Why you shouldn't use JavaScript?

**You shouldn't use JavaScript** because:

- It is fast, but not as fast as C or Rust,
- Many of people know it, it is good, but for searching one ideal job as a JS dev, it isn't,
- It is nice to have a lot of frameworks, for backend and frontend, but the way, how much frameworks are for JS became a meme.
