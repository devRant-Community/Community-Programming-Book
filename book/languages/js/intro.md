## Inception

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language, used as a scripting language in
web pages to generate dynamic content. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a part of the core
technologies powering the World Wide Web and the Internet we know today.

Though it was intended to be used as a client-side scripting language to generate dynamic web pages,
JS has different variants that can handle applications such as the *front-end* of a website/web
application (Vue.js, React.js, etc) and server-side scripting a.k.a the *back-end* of a website/web
application (Node.js, etc).

Some of its variants are also used in creating desktop and mobile native apps (Proton, Electron, etc)

> The file extension of JavaScript is .js

```md
 The ".js" extension in the names of some frameworks like
 React.js is supposed to mean that they are related to
 JavaScript and not that they are individual files
 written in JavaScript.
