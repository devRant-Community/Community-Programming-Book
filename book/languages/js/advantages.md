# Purpose & Advantages

JavaScript was initially created to fulfill the following requirements :

* Must be able to assemble components like plug-ins and images in web pages.

* Must be a lightweight scripting language.

* Must run in the browser environment itself and the code included in the markup of the website.

* Must complement Java.

* Easy to learn and use by web developers and amateur programmers.

However over subsequent versions, JavaScript was able to do *more* than assemble components on web
pages. Later versions of JavaScript included capabilities such as event driven programming which
basically meant that the user was able to *interact* with the web page. This made way for
*[Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0)* where websites were able to interact with the
user and able to generate content based on user driven events or actions unlike the *Web 1.0* where
static content was served and the user was only able to read it.

Even further improvements meant that JS was able to handle server-side scripts and computing and
also used in developing native and stand-alone applications instead of being only restricted to the
browser environment. Also JacvaScript has a relatively high speed of execution though not as fast
as C or Rust.
