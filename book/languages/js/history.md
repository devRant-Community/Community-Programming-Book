# History

**Netscape**. That company had the most popular web browser in the world in the beginnings of '90s.
 But in late 1995 **Microsoft** came with their **Internet Explorer** project that (in plans) would be the domination over Netscape browser.
 Netscape had a plan, they partnered with **Sun** Company, that also had a browser, but it was resource hungry one.
 **Sun** started development of **Java** programming language in 1990 trying to make something for *smart* devices.
 Also, that partnership was a thing to don't let Microsoft take control on JavaScript, which Sun and Netscape started developing in early '90.
 That partnership means that Sun gets the web browser and a delivery system for their strategic technology.
 On the other hand, **Netscape have a partner against Microsoft**.
 **Brendan Eich** with Sun decided to surf the tidal wave of hype surrounding **Java and position JavaScript as the companion language to Java**, in the same way, Visual Basic was to C++.
 The aim of **Netscape Mocha** (later **JavaScript** and later officially **ECMAScript**) was making Web a platform for apps to use with **LiveWire** software.
 **JavaScript** has a fascinating and rich history but it's still one of the most hated programming languages on the planet.
