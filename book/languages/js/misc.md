## An Example

This section will compare JavaScript to other languages.

### Hello World example.

JavaScript

```JavaScript
"use strict"  // start your scripts with this to avoid bad practices
console.log("Hello world!");  // semicolon is not mandatory but recommended
```

Kotlin

```Kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello world!")
}
```

Python

```Python
print "Hello world!"
```

Ruby

```Ruby
puts "Hello world!"
```

That example was a simple one, we all were starting from writing Hello World, isn't we?
