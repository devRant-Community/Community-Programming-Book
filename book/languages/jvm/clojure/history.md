# History

## The begginings

**Rick Hickey** is the creator of Clojure. Before Clojure he developed a similar language, **dotLisp**, but it was based on the .NET platform and three earlier attempts to provide interoperability between JVM and Lisp (**jfli, FOIL and Lisplets**).

He spent *around* 2.5 years working on the language before realeasing it to the public and much of that time without outside funding. At the end of that time, Hickey sent an email to some of his friends in Lisp community announcing the Clojure language.
