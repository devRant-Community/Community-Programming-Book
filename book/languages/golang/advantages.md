## Advantages of Golang.

Here are some advantages of using it:

* **Go compiles directly to the machine code**, compilation is fast, **cross-platform** and it creates only one executable file without dependencies,

* It is **safe**, it's strong and static typed. Also, garbage would be collected and you can make really reliable software using Go,

* It supports some kinds of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, supports interfaces,

* You can attach functions to any type, that's real flexibility,

* Also, Golang supports functional programming as **anonymous functions**, **closueres** and **first-class functions**,

* Almost all things comes with standard library, that is part of Go by default, that things are like **http fetching**, **json parsing** and **encryption**,

* Nice feature, Go has great built-in command-line tools (ex. **auto-formatting your code**, **test coverage reporting**, **refactoring tools**).
