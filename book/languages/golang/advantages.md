# Advantages of Golang

## Here are some advantages of using it

* **Go compiles directly into machine code**. The compilation is fast, **cross-platform compatible** and it creates only
  one executable file without dependencies.

* It is **safe**, as it uses strong and static typing. Also, garbage would be collected automatically and
  you can make really reliable software using Go.

* It supports some kinds of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and interfaces.

* You can attach functions to any type. That's real flexibility.

* Also, Golang supports functional programming features like **anonymous functions**, **closueres** and **first-class functions**.

* Common utilities like **HTTP fetching**, **JSON  parsing** and **encryption** are included by default in Go in the form of standard libraries.
  
* Go has great built-in command-line tools (ex. **auto-formatting your code**, **test coverage reporting**, **refactoring tools**).
