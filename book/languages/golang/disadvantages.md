# Disadvantages of Golang

## Some `bad` stuff about Golang

* *No support for generics*, but Golang team is *still* thinking about adding it.

* **Smaller amount of packages** compared to Node.js or Ruby.

* *No support* for overloading a function.

* Some may like, some may hate, Golang is an **imperative** type of language.
