# Conclusion

Some say that now is just a hype for Golang.
Some say that Golang is hipster programming language.
But I'll say something more.

I think the Golang is usefully language, specially for backend things.
It's really fast, and for some, syntax similar to C would be an advantage thing.
I think that is nice to learn some Golang, because there are more and more job offers with Golang knowledge required.
