**Golang** (GO) is another high-level programming language.
It's usually used to make **backend stuff**.
But, as it always is, community made a lot of frameworks based on Golang,
for example, A framework to use Golang as a frontend language (ex. **Buffalo**).
Also, you can create Desktop UI in Golang.
Amount of frameworks for Golang is not such a big deal as it was for JavaScript,
but it's nice to have something more than just pure language.

If you want to see full list of Golang libraries, packages and stuff, you can see it [here](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#database).

> The file extension for Golang is **.go**
