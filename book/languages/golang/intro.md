# Introduction

## Inception

**Golang** (GO) is another high-level programming language.
It's usually used to make **backend stuff**.
`Backend stuff`, I mean, for example rest API for your website, CMS for your website or chatbot.
But, as it always is, the community made a lot of frameworks based on Golang,
for example, A framework to use Golang as a frontend language (ex. **Buffalo**).

Also, you can create Desktop UI in Golang.
Amount of frameworks for Golang is not such a big deal as it was for JavaScript,
but it's nice to have something more than just pure language.

## More engineering stuff here

Golang is a statically typed compiled language in the tradition of C, but with some more features.
Overall, **Go's syntax is similar to C's syntax**.

That features as I said are for example:

* **garbage collection**

* **structural typing**

* **concurrent programming**

Tools for Golang, compiler and source code of Golang are free and open-source.

If you want to see the full list of Golang libraries, packages, and stuff, you can see it [here](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#database).

> The file extension for Golang is **.go**
