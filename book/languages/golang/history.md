# History

## Far, far away in a company called **Google**... was created the Golang programming language

It was announced in **November 2009**,
but its 1.0 version was released in **March 2012**.

It's originally designed by **Robert Griesemer**, **Rob Pike** and **Ken Thompson**.
They were **Google** engineers and Go was an experiment.

They wanted to make programming language:

* that **doesn't require** IDE but with support for them,

* that **supports** networking and multitasking,

* that **is productive and readable**, without excessive boilerplate (like Ruby or Python has),

* that **is statically typed** and **scalable** to large systems (ex. Java or C++).

## Golang now

Now Golang is used in some of **Google** production systems, but it's well-recognized language on whole Earth.
