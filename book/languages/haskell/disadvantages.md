#Disadvantages of using Haskell

## Bad stuff about Haskell, but who cares, because it's cool

* For some, that stuff like <:> >>= <=< @>-,-'--() in every line can be annoying

* Some people are going mad when they see all the possible ways to write our the same thing

* Tooling is limited, awkward and slow

* Library quality and coverage is inconsistent, you can't easily do UI development and machine learning with Haskell, lack of libraries

* If you don't have a beefy PC, don't even try to compile Haskell code, you're gonna probably be faster a fossil fuel than your crappy PC will compile your code, just loading modules into GHC can take almost half a minute
