# Introduction

## Inception

**Haskell** is **standardized, general-purpose compiled purely functional programming language**.
Haskell is written in several languages but **it's basically a mixture of C and Assembly**.
This language was created, by the whole team, that included:

* Lennart Augustsson
* Dave Barton
* Brian Boutel
* Warren Burton
* Joseph Fasel
* Kevin Hammond
* Ralf Hinze
* Paul Hudak
* John Hughes
* Thomas Johnsson
* Mark Jones
* Simon Peyton Jones
* John Launchbury
* Erik Meijer
* John Peterson
* Alastair Reid
* Colin Runciman
* Philip Wadler

## Features, engineering stuff here

**Haskell** has a lot of features, the most known, are here:

* lazy evaluation

* monads

* type polymorphism

* type classes

* pattern matching

* lambda expressions

* cache in functions

**Haskell** specification is published and open for everyone. **Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)** is its main implementation, which is both, native-code compiler and interpreter, that runs on most of the platforms.
