# Advantages of using Haskell

## Haskell is cool, because

* Pattern matching syntax, avoiding 'if' statements

* Recursive types that may contain many other values of the same type
  
* Inferred types
  
* Lazy evaluation, they delay the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed

* Monads, which provide us a single way to describe many types of computation that seem very different at first
