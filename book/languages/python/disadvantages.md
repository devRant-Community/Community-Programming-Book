# Disadvantages

Given such a lengthy description on how good is python as a programming language it is easy to be
mistaken that python does not have any shortcomings. Some are listed:

* Since python is an interpreted language and it being built on C/C++ execution speed is slow. But
  the benefits/advantages dramatically outweigh this issue.

* Due to the above point python scripts are slower than other scripting languages.

* Database access layers are underdeveloped in python so server side applications involving extensive
  database use usually are not written in python.

* Rare run time errors due to the dynamic typing of variables.

* Errors are detected only when the buggy code is executed. In a production environment this could
  be a problem.

* Migration from python 2 to python 3 is a real pain.
