# What it solves

Python is a very simple to learn language and attempts to make development process easier with some
of its powerful features. One of them is modularity. This has helped in the making of extremely useful libraries which
can do a job in the matter of a ready-made function call in python instead of wasting time in developing
the utilities first and then using them in case of other languages.

Several such libraries are created that can be included or "imported" as per need (modularity FTW)
and there are python libraries for virtually anything. This is one major advantage of using python
for developing anything.

> Search for what you want to do and there's bound to be a library for the same.

Python is created to be very flexible in the sense that its core is extremely bare-boned and all its
utilities are included externally in the form of modules or packages and can easily accommodate
changes unlike few other languages that have features included in their core and have limited scope
for major changes without compatibility issues.
