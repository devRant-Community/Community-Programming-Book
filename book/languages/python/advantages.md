# Where would you use python?

Python doesn't have a target audience. It can be used for multiple purposes and there are several
libraries and frameworks built to  simplify specific applications. Some fields where python can be best
used are:

*Examples of libraries/frameworks built for the particular application are given in brackets.*

* Web development (Django, Flask)

* Data analysis (Numpy)

* Machine learning (TensorFlow)

* Computer Vision (OpenCV)

* Game development (Pygame)

* Web Scraping (Beautiful Soup)

* GUI development (PyQt)

* Rapid prototyping

and the list goes on and on...

Python can also be used in places where precise numerical calculations are required because precision
in calculations in python is limited only by physical resources and not the language. This feature
makes python one of the best language to be used in scientific works.
