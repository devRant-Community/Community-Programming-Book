# Conclusion

C is excellent language for embedded development. It's mixture of lower level programming, which is possible in C (see BIOS
implemented in C; Linux kernel was implemented in C too), but also higher level programming - there is theoretical possibility of
OOP simulation in C, getting rid of the part where C is not shining.

One thing is sure - **nothing, ever** will replace C. C will remain ruling IT world, **[forever](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)**.
